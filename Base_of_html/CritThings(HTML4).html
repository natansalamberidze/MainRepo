  <p class="custom-font box4"> Quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord
    very
    pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of
    my bedfellow.However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good thing; the more’s the pity.
    So, if any one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but
    let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the man that has anything bountifully
    laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.The bar-room was now full of the
    boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were nearly
    all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea
    blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy
    set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.
    This young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky; he
    cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might
    say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached
    withal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with
    various tints, seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by
    zone.“Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to breakfast.They say that men who
    have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:
    Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they possessed the least
    assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the
    taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s
    performances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish. Still, for
    the most part, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere. </p>
